## What GridViewer Can Do

**GridViewer** is an interactive and lightweight open source web-based tool designed for ham radio operators to visualize and analyze their worked grid squares from log files. Hereâ€™s what you can do with GridViewer:

### Key Features

#### 1. Interactive Grid Map

- Displays all worked grid squares on an interactive map using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.
- Each grid square is highlighted so you can easily see your coverage.


#### 2. Powerful Filtering

- **Band Filtering:** Instantly filter your contacts by amateur radio band (e.g., 6M, 2M, 20M, etc.) using intuitive checkboxes.
- **Mode Filtering:** Select which transmission modes (e.g., FT8, SSB, CW) to display.
- **Year Filtering:** Focus on contacts made in specific years, or view all years at once.
- **Select All \& Reset:** Quickly select or reset all options in each filter category for fast exploration.


#### 3. Hover-Over Details

- Hover your mouse over any highlighted grid square to see a popup with:
    - The callsigns you have worked in that square.
    - The year(s) each callsign was worked (e.g., "SM0ABC (2024, 2025)").

#### 4. Real-Time Log Updates

- The tool automatically reloads your log file at regular intervals (default: every 30 minutes), so your map stays up to date as you make new QSOs.

#### 5. User-Friendly Interface

- Clean, responsive design that works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- All controls are accessible and hopefully intuitive, with clear labels and logical grouping.
